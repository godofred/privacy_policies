# PsyTech's Privacy Policy

## 1. Introduction

This privacy policy specifies how we treat the information that users input in the PsyTech app, and the permissions that are required to use the app.

We understand that thoughts are probably the most private personal information. So they should not be shared with anyone if that is not explicitly desired by the user. That is why privacy is our number one concern while developing PsyTech, and we will never collect nor share data regarding users' thoughts without the users explicitly initiating an action to do so in the app.

We believe that, although user's data should be opaque, communication should be transparent. So, we will disclose all relevant information in accessible language in this Policy.

## 2. Data Protection

By default, any information that is stored by the PsyTech app is accessible only to the user that inputted that information.

Currently, any information that is provided by the users to the app is only safely stored locally, in the internal storage of the user's own device, accessible only by the PsyTech app, and not accessible by any other apps.

## 3. Permissions

Currently, the only permission that is requested is `Access to the Internet`, which is used for the sole purpose of rotating Ads in the app.

## 4. Device Usage Data

The PsyTech app does not collect, nor store, nor process in any way any device usage information, nor any information that is not explicitly provided by the user through the app.

## 4. Updates to Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may change in the future when new features are implemented. If/when this occurs, this privacy policy will be updated accordingly. In any case, the user will have the freedom to choose to use any new features that might collect or share specific user data, or to continue to use the app in a local-only manner.
